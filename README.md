# Asteroids #
* My version of the famous Atari game built using Canvas and Javascript.
##Features##
* Follows Object Oriented programming principles by having the parent class "moving object" and child classes(ship, asteroid, bullet) that inherit most of their properties from the moving object class.
* Uses HTML5's Canvas to render images on the page.
* Keeps track of player's score and lives left.
